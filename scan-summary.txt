# Vulnerability Scan Report â€“ Localhost (127.0.0.1)

## Findings

### 1. SSL/TLS: Report Weak Cipher Suites
- Severity: Medium (5.9)
- Port: 5432/tcp
- Risk: Service supports weak ciphers, vulnerable to downgrade attacks.
- Fix: Enforce TLS 1.2+ and disable weak cipher suites.

### 2. Weak MAC Algorithm(s) Supported (SSH)
- Severity: Low (2.6)
- Port: 22/tcp
- Risk: Weak message authentication codes reduce integrity protection.
- Fix: Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to allow only `hmac-sha2-256` or stronger.

### 3. SSL/TLS: Self-Signed Certificate Detected
- Severity: Informational
- Port: 5432/tcp
- Risk: Not trusted by clients, could allow MITM.
- Fix: Replace with trusted CA certificate.

### 4. Service Enumeration
- Ports: 22/tcp (SSH), 5432/tcp (PostgreSQL)
- Risk: Provides attackers with reconnaissance info.
- Fix: Restrict access to trusted IPs and keep services patched.
